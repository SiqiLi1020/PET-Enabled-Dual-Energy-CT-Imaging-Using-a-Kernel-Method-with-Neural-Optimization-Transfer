# Single-Subject Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction with a Neural Optimization Transfer Algorithm for PET-Enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging

This demo code shows how to reconstruct the gamma-ray CT (gCT) image from PET emission data. The reconstructed high-energy (511keV) gCT is then combined with the already-existing X-ray CT image to form dual-energy pairs. 

The proposed method, called "Neural KAA", is described in:

# Prerequistites:
	Python 3.7 (or 3.x)
	GPU-based PyTorch
	Matlab

# Overview



The neural KAA reconstruction consists of three separate steps: 

(1) a KEM step for image update from the projection data

(2) a deep-learning step in the image domain for updating the kernel coefficient image

# Neural KEM for dynamic PET reconstruction:

a). You can run 'demo_Nerual_KEM.m' to test the proposed method on Zubal phantom simulation that we used in the paper.

b).	'DIP_step.py' is a function to run the step of deep coefficient prior (deep learning), and the whole reconstruction is implemented on Matlab

# Required packages for PET reconstruction:

a).	To use this package, you need to add the KER_v0.11 package into your matlab path by
  	running setup.m in matlab. KER_v0.11 package can be downloaded from:
   
	https://wanglab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/code

b).	To test the algorithms in the package, run "demo_Neural_KEM.m" in the current folder. You
  	may need your own system matrix G or use Jeff Fessler's IRT matlab toolbox to 
  	generate one. IRT can downloaded from 
  
      	http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html
