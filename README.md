# Single-Subject Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction with a Neural Optimization Transfer Algorithm for PET-Enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging

This demo code shows how to reconstruct the gamma-ray CT (gCT) image from PET emission data. The reconstructed high-energy (511keV) gCT is then combined with the already-existing X-ray CT image to form dual-energy pairs. 

The proposed method, called "Neural KAA", is described in:

# Overview

![figure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9a35c03-a26d-4fbc-925f-cceb4be4005d)

The neural KAA reconstruction consists of three separate steps: 

(1) PET activity image update (MLEM) 

(2) gCT image update (KTR)

(3) A weighted least-square neural-network learning in the gCT image domain

# Neural KEM for dynamic PET reconstruction:

a). Please run 'Test_demo.m' to test the proposed method and compare it with other methods in the simulation study that we used in the paper.

b). 'DIP_step.py' is a function running the step of a weighted least-square neural-network learning in the gCT image domain, and the whole reconstruction is implemented on Matlab.

# Required packages for PET reconstruction:

To use this package, you need to add the "KER_v0.11" and "PLOT_v1.0" packages into your Matlab path by running setup.m in Matlab. Both packages can be downloaded from:
