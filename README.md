# Single-Subject Deep-Learning Image Reconstruction With a Neural Optimization Transfer Algorithm for PET-Enabled Dual-Energy CT Imaging

This demo code shows how to reconstruct the gamma-ray CT (gCT) image from PET emission data. The reconstructed high-energy (511keV) gCT is then combined with already-existing X-ray CT image to form dual-energy pairs.
